Rainydays was the first cross-course project I got given on my Frontend Development course at Noroff School of Technology and Media. 

## Description

For this initial project I was set out a task to make a website for a company that sells rainjackets for all kinds of weather. The requirements were to have a userfriendly design that was aimed at men and women ages 30 to 50. 

The site had to contain these specific pages in the site architecture:

- Home
- List of Jackets
- A product specific page
- A checkout page
- A checkout success page
- About
- Contact

## Built With:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Wordpress API


### Where to find the deployed site?

You can find the link to the site itself below:
