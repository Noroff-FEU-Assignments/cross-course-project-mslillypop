 LF-CA-HTML-CSS

This readme file is my report for the CA in the HTML and CSS module. 

# Introduction: 
This document is to show my process and the obstacles faced during the coding of my chosen briefs website. 

# My process: 
I have used VSCode as my primary code editor and within it I have used the prettier plugin as well as live server to keep track of my progress as I went along. I also found the use of the chrome devtools very useful to see where I may have added extra spaces or divs where they are not needed. 
The original design in my Figma file (which is linked at the bottom of this document) will show that I did make some changes in my design. The biggest change is the hamburger menu. When I started the coding I did the desktop version first, and when it came to creating the hamburger menu I could not get the code to work. I asked for help on the discord server and one of the students from a different class helped with a very good code “template”, however even after following this step by step I could not get it to work. 
How can I improve this for next time: Code mobile-first and do desktop after. I believe had I started over with my code I would have managed to get it to work, I however did not have enough time left to do it all over again. This is something I will try to fix in my own time. And hopefully will be an easier issue to resolve with JS once we start learning that. 

The coding itself was fairly simple, I like how VSCode has emmet shortcuts for code, making this much easier. The only thing I am a bit confused with is whenever I save my files it adds an extra / near any >. In return, when I do a W3C accessibility check it flags as an info tag because I have used / where it's not needed. Not sure how to fix this other than not using prettier next time?

I have run both Wave and W3C accessibility checkers and wave is showing a few issues. 
Firstly, it's showing that some of my links are empty when they are not. This in particular is my nav bar as well as the links in my footer. I was not able to figure out the reasoning for this. 
Secondly, it came up that the colours of my header/footer and navbar were badly contrasted and hard to read. So I changed my header/footer colours to a darker green and the text colour to a pure white. Still I was getting the same error and I was recommended a separate contrast checker (WebAIM) which shows my colours are all a pass. So I have left them as the darker background/lighter text option rather than reverting it to my original Figma design colour. I am hopeful this will suffice as the contrast checker independently said there were no issues. 

# To conclude: 
Seeing as this is my first-ever encounter with both HTML and CSS I feel like I did a good job even though a few of my original design choices did not work out for me. I feel like that is something I can work on in my own time and hopefully that will not be a limitation next time.
