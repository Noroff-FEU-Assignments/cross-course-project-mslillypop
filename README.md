This shop design is fictional and designed as part of a course in front-end development via Noroff. 

The design is different compared to my original design in some aspects, but others are still the same.
The main thing to note is I could not get the hamburger menu to work and I did not have time to start over with my document. Note to next time will be to do mobile first as to not run out of time. I believe this will be easier with the use of JS anyway, but sadly could not get it to work this time. Will continue to try. 

I have run both the wave and the W3 accessability checker and both had some red flags. Some say the links are empty, which they are not? So I was unable to change those. 
One of them noted that my header and menu items had contrast issues. I made my header a shade darker and my menu text pure white,  they still fail on wave. But after checking the colours in a contrast checker they do say they have passed on all levels; therefore I have left them as they are with the darker colour.
I am also getting an info tag on w3 because I have used / by a > when its not needed, but this is done automatically with prettier or one of my other mods, everytime I save my html it auto does the />. I have corrected all the other flags that came up on my first run through. 

Have also found the chrome devtools very useful in my builds to help identify where I have made mistakes or where things might be getting in the way of what I want it to do.

I also decided to have the menu go to the right rather than split, also an accessibility issue. 

I was sadly not able to ask for review from my tutor because I had limit access to my email the past week, but I had valuable feedback from my peers which I have taken in to account whilst doing the finishing touches of my project.
