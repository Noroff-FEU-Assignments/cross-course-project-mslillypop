    <h1>Hello world!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my first website.</p>
    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? 
    <br>
    Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer"> Web security is aimed at protecting your site information from intruders. There are certain things you can do to secure your site. You should have a <b>proper authorisation framework</b> in place, which is two factor authentication. This can be achieved through apps, emails or phone. There are several options so find one that fits your company the best. <br>
    Ensure that any staff working on your website are following proper protocol, not opening untrusted links etc. <b>Automatic timeout</b> of users are important as well, to hinder any access being unintentionally given if someone leaves their computer unattended.</p>
    <p>When installing applications to your web site ensure that the applications are well-known and trustworthy. Downloading unrecognised material can be a great risk to your company. I also recommend using <b>HTTPS</b> to increase security of communication on your website by encrypting data sent on the network. <br>
    Any data that is sensitive, such as card information, contact details etc will need to be stored and encrypted properly to ensure your customers online data safety. </p>
    <p>There are scanning tools that can be set up to automatically scan your site and will flag if it finds any bugs. This will help catch anything early and fixed before harm is done. </p>
    <p>And lastly, find a good web host for your site. One that is trusted and has good security measures in place. This will further increase the security of your site.
